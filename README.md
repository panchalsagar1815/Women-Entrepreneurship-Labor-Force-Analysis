# Women-Entrepreneurship-Labor-Force-Analysis


The "Women Entrepreneurship Labor Force Analysis" project is a detailed examination of the relationship between women's entrepreneurship and labour force dynamics, considering various socio-economic factors. The features under investigation include country, level of development, European Union membership, currency, women's entrepreneurship index, inflation rate, and female labour force participation rate.


This study aims to shed light on the intricate interplay between economic development, entrepreneurial opportunities, and the active participation of women in the labour force. Through a comprehensive analysis of these features, the project seeks to identify patterns, correlations, and potential influencing factors for women's entrepreneurship and labour force participation.

Utilizing advanced statistical methods and data analytics, the project endeavours to provide valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders interested in promoting women's entrepreneurship and workforce inclusion. By exploring the impact of variables such as country-level development, EU membership, currency, and inflation rate on women's entrepreneurial endeavours and labour force engagement, the project aspires to contribute to informed decision-making in the realm of gender-inclusive economic policies and initiatives.
